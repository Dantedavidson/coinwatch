### The challenge

This project was made during the interview process for a crypto-currency firm. It needed to cover the following:

- Display a paginated list of Cryptocurrencies and provide further information in an
appropriate form
- A loading state whilst data is being pulled and provide an error state if the call fails.
- A unit test for the component
